As part of the final year of my course in pursuit of a BSc degree in Computer Science, I have been tasked with defining, designing and ultimately implementing a project of my own choosing, as approved by tutors, that - if completed, can be demonstrated at Teesside University's annual ExpoTees event.


As a near requirement of this project, I will be maintaining a series of blog posts documenting the progress of my project, and the research made in the process of making the intended end result a reality. This blog will ultimately serve to document all that will be required in the final report to be submitted at the end of the three-month period afforded to this project.

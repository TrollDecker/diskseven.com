Further to the prior proposal post, the finished product, as at the time of hand-in, should consist of a collection of services and the databases that they will use. The service itself, will be constructed using Python and the Django web framework, as a means to dynamically produce the necessary pages and forms based upon the data stored within the required PostgreSQL-based databases.


To that end, the final product should ideally contain:


* The individual Django-based systems and PostgreSQL databases containing the necessary tables relevant to each type of medium represented by the system - movies, music, books, comics and video games - as well as the individuals involved in each piece of media, be they actual cast and crew or the characters depicted, and the necessary account data required for maintaining user accounts and personal collection data.
* A web-based front-end for the purposes of viewing and updating media and account information.
* A simple, easy-to-use API that will allow external developers access to the service's data for the purposes of app or tool development.


Of course, I will be restricted by the following contraints that may limit my progress with this project or even force myself to make sacrifices on its final functionality:


* Time - This project may prove to be somewhat ambitious in its scale and the quantity of work that would be required to complete it to a satisfactory state.
* Cost of maintaining the service - as the overall size of the data and userbase inevitably increases, the cost of maintaining the service, such as ensuring sufficient space for the that data as well as bandwidth to accomodate a potential increase in concurrent users, may rise significantly.

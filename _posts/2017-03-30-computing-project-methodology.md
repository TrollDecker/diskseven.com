For this project, I have opted to employ the use Kanban, an agile development methodology that has been adapted to software creation from its origins at the Toyota Motor Corporation. This methodology appears to bear some similarities to Scrum, though I beleive it may be better suited to an individual developer than the team-orientated latter.[[1]][[2]]


I believe this will allow myself to remain focused on a specific part of the project each week, while also affording me the opportunity to return to prior tasks, if briefly, should an unforeseen issue arise, something utterly vital to a project of this scale, and that a waterfall methodology could not accommodate.[[3]][[4]]

Long story short, this academic year has thrown me for a loop. Longer story: all kinds of problems ranging from ill health to laptop death conspired to derail just about every goal I had this year, and ultimately I was forced to suspend my studies and redo my entire third year next year.

Fun.

So what's that mean? Well, my final year project went absolutely nowhere. The posts will remain here, but I'll tag them with an extra category. I don't go back to uni until September, so that gives me a month and a bit to try and recover. In the meantime, I'm looking into trying to learn C again (after my last attempt was hampered by a poorly-formatted book). I've also got to claw back some funds in order to replace my dead laptop, a flimsy Toshiba Satellite that seemed to be designed to go kaput after about a year or two. I also have a few ideas for some personal projects, but it's debatable whether I can get those sorted before Uni, but if I can, great. It's a lot more under my belt than the bare minimum I've maintained over the past few years.

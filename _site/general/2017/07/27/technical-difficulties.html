    <p>Long story short, this academic year has thrown me for a loop. Longer story: all kinds of problems ranging from ill health to laptop death conspired to derail just about every goal I had this year, and ultimately I was forced to suspend my studies and redo my entire third year next year.</p>

<p>Fun.</p>

<p>So what’s that mean? Well, my final year project went absolutely nowhere. The posts will remain here, but I’ll tag them with an extra category. I don’t go back to uni until September, so that gives me a month and a bit to try and recover. In the meantime, I’m looking into trying to learn C again (after my last attempt was hampered by a poorly-formatted book). I’ve also got to claw back some funds in order to replace my dead laptop, a flimsy Toshiba Satellite that seemed to be designed to go kaput after about a year or two. I also have a few ideas for some personal projects, but it’s debatable whether I can get those sorted before Uni, but if I can, great. It’s a lot more under my belt than the bare minimum I’ve maintained over the past few years.</p>

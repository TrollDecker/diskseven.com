    <p>In determining a project I would like to work on, I felt that it was necessary to consider some problems I had personally encountered in life, and that had yet to be - in my opinion - suitably addressed. However, the problems I felt that I could address were few and far between, with the likes of, say, the harassment problem that plagues proprietary social media platforms of late[<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-17/disney-said-to-have-dropped-twitter-pursuit-partly-over-image">1</a>][<a href="http://fortune.com/2016/10/18/twitter-disney-salesforce/">2</a>] seeming somewhat out of my own league.</p>

<p>One problem, however, did remain on my mind for some years now, as it had been a constant source of infuriation for myself personally, and I realised that this computing project, and the skills I have learned in pursuit of my degree, could actually allow me to address: To this day, I have yet to find a suitable piece of software or service that can assist my ability to catalogue and keep track of my own media releases, and given the increasing prevalence of cheaper digital media, and the rise of frequent (and often ridiculous) sales and bundles offered by the various current digital distribution platforms, that was most certainly a hole that needed filling, in my opinion.</p>

<p>As someone whose own personal media collection has near-uncontrollably ballooned since the launch of the first Humble Indie Bundle in 2010[<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2010/05/the-greatest-indie-game-sale-ever-and-how-it-came-to-be/">3</a>], I find it almost impossible to keep track of my current collection across the multitudes of services from which I have purchased. As such, I am often faced with potential dilemmas in which I face the risk of making a duplicate purchase, without a suitably efficient means of being able to check. Even in this day and age of digital media, I face this dilemma when making physical purchases, a situation that has at least once resulted in myself actually making that duplicate purchase as recently as last year. If you’re curious, it was Deep Dish’s Flashdance, and I have still yet to figure out what to do with the duplicate.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I feel there is at least a need, at least for myself personally, for a means to catalogue and organise my personal media collection digitally, and with the ability to check that collection from just about anywhere, be it at my desk whenever a new bundle or sale is launched, or in a charity shop searching for some CDs that I could never acquire in my younger years.</p>

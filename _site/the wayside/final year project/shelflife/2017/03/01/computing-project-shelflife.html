    <p>In the prior post I outlined the problem I wanted to address with my project, and the ideas milling about my head to that end resulted in one workable idea.</p>

<p>I call it ShelfLife.</p>

<p>ShelfLife would be a web-based media database and collection organiser, designed to store records about media releases in their various forms, as well as their creators and contributors, and allow users to maintain personal collections that they could access from any device.</p>

<p>In its simplest terms, ShelfLife should ideally work thus:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The service should store records about media releases in various forms - initially only a few to begin with - and encourages users to fill in any gaps in those records, be they small details or entire releases that have been absent.</li>
  <li>However, users should not get away with adding whatever they pleased with any kind of abandon. A voting system should be in place to prevent erroneous or malicious edits from being committed. Users submitting data should be expected to back up their contributions with some evidence, which should not be too difficult to produce if one is submitting such data - it should likely be in their possession to begin with, after all.</li>
  <li>Users should be able to build personal lists of releases to serve as a means to catalogue their own personal media collections, though these lists could be used for other purposes.</li>
  <li>The service should provide an API to provide developers with the access needed to develop their own apps or tools that utilise the service.</li>
</ul>

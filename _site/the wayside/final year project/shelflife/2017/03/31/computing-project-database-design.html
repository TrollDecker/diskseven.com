<ul>
  <li><strong>User</strong>: Stores user-specific data such as their personal information and their shelves.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>ReleaseShelf</strong> stores many-to-many links between releases and users’ shelves (a shelf can hold many releases and a release can be held by many shelves).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Edit</strong>: Maintains details of edits made on records, and the votes for and against each one.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Edit</strong> (the eponymous table) maintains a one-to-many relationship with the Release table: a release can be edited many times, but an edit can only affect one release at a time.</li>
      <li><strong>Vote</strong> maintains one-to-many relationships with Edit (an edit can be voted upon many times, but a vote only applies on one edit), as well as User (a user can cast many votes, but a vote can only be attributed to one user.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Series</strong>: Holds data on a series, the individual volumes within that series, and the type-agnostic data for a release. Includes a NestedRelease table for releases bundled within releases (for example, box sets).
    <ul>
      <li>In addition to the aforementioned relationships, <strong>Release</strong> is also linked by many-to-many relationships and one-to-many relationships between their more type-specific systems.</li>
      <li><strong>ReleaseCover</strong> stores many-to-many links between covers and releases, as it’s entirely possible for a single media release to possess alternative covers. An example of this is comics, in which a single issue can release with several available variant covers.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Book</strong>: Contains data on books released in a series. This data would not only include paperback and hardback formats, but also magazine formats, allowing the incorporation of comics without the need for a separate database and repeated data for collected editions.
    <ul>
      <li>The <strong>ReleaseExtra</strong> table maintains an addition foreign-key relationship to a currency table to accommodate the RRPs usually listed on books.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Movie</strong>: This table is a bit of a misnomer in one sense, as it would not only include the usual feature-length releases that many associate with the term, but also any kind of motion picture, be it a TV show, short film, documentary, or - of course - feature-length releases, among other possible forms.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>FeatureComponent</strong> maintains two additional one-to-many relationships to the Definition and Aspect Ratio tables, allowing such video data to be included in this system’s records.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Music</strong>: Holds information on music releases that include albums and singles, as well as EPs.</li>
  <li><strong>Game</strong>: Contains information on videogame releases.</li>
  <li><strong>Organisation</strong>: Contains information on the organisations involved in the production of a media release.</li>
  <li><strong>Person</strong>: Holds information in the individual people involved, whether they are real persons directly involved in a release’s creation or fictitious characters depicted by that media.</li>
  <li><strong>Format</strong>: Stores formatting data about a release.</li>
  <li><strong>International</strong>: Maintains data relevant to a release’s national origin and point of sale.</li>
  <li><strong>Cover</strong>: Maintains data regarding the covers of each release.</li>
</ul>

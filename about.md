Caffeine-dependent computer science student. In the process Iâ€™ve amassed XP in Java, C#, web development, database design, AI and information systems security, among other things.

Generally likes:

* Way too many comics.
* My ever-expanding collection of video games.
* An alarming range of musical genres that shifts between 90s/2000s trance, italo disco, happy hardcore and chiptunes, among so many other (and sometimes unlikely) genres.
* Exploring game files for fun and profit. Mostly fun, though. Actually just fun. Did you know the PC version of TrickStyle seems to have shipped with the VMU images necessary for the Dreamcast rele- WAIT, COME BAAAACK!
